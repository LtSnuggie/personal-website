		<div class="body">
			Starting in 2013 my friends and I started going to road Packer games every year. This picture was taken at the Rocky Mountain State Park, the day before we played the Bronco's. Both teams were 6-0 going into the game. We ended up losing but we still had a great trip.

		<div class="body">
			Growing up I was always into sports. I took swim lessons at a young age and basically lived for the pool. My parents couldn't keep me out of the water, and signed me up for a swim team. I continued to swim competitively until I graduated high school.

		<div class="body">
			When I hit middle school I finally found on of my biggest passions, soccer. When I hit High School I was nominated for an international traveling team. The first year we played in Italy and Austria, and the second year we played in Denmark and Sweden. I continued to play club throughout college and now play for a club in Austin called ATXUnited.
